# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The raw data for this project comes from accelerometers on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The goal of this project was to create a tidy dataset from the original raw data and submit it for review by my peers. In this repo you will find the script called run_analysis.R I used to convert the data into it's tidy format as well as two csv files with the tidy data:

* full_tidyData.csv: this is the entire cleaned dataset before finding the means for each person and activity
* tidyData.csv: this is the summarized dataset, grouped by person and activity
